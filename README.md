About:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Round Robin Algorithm mini project, a journey driven by my humble curiosity and passion for exploration. As a student who delights in unraveling complex concepts, I embarked on this endeavor to rectify the inaccuracies plaguing existing Round Robin scheduling algorithms. Each step of this journey has been an opportunity for personal growth and learning. From learning how to translate intricate algorithms into understandable code to dipping my toes into microprocessor architectures, with special reference to 8086 and 80386 series, I've sought to deepen my understanding and hone my skills.

Embracing the principles of Database Management Systems (DBMS), I've utilized concepts like primary keys and foreign keys to establish associations between process numbers and their details using 1-D as well as 2-D arrays. This association type ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient retrieval of process information. Through this project, I wanted to embrace my innate curiosity and love for exploration. I may or may not have ended up typing up the code of the final version that you see in a single day as I was fueled by motivation to see it through.
